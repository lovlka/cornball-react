## About The Cornball

The goal of The Cornball is to put all the cards in order from 2 to king with one color on each line. What color is put on each line does not matter.

Twos can only be put in a gap on the far left on the board. Other cards can only be put in a gap to the right of the card in the same color that is right before in order. No card can be put in a gap after the king.

Drag a card to the right gap or double-click the card to automatically find the right place. Click on a gap and the right card for that gap will flash.

Thank you for playing The Cornball!
